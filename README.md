## üß© Awesome features

At Github, we want to start new projects faster using best practices with a predefined structure and focusing on core ideas implementation rather than wasting time on environment configuration and copying boilerplate code.

I defined a spec template that I could use to quickly start building a full-fledged project.

In each directory, there is a README.md and an OWNERS, which explains what the directory does and who owns it.


## üõ´ Quick start 

> **Note**: You can get started quickly with go-project-layout.

1. Generate a new repository from the template.
2. Clone the repository locally.
3. Update files, read the README files in each directory.
4. Write your code and tests.
